        <p> If all cycles are high, individuals may feel confident, energetic, and mentally sharp, making it an optimal time for tasks requiring physical exertion, emotional engagement, or intellectual focus.</p>
        <p>If the physical cycle is low but the emotional and intellectual cycles are high, individuals may still feel emotionally stable and mentally sharp, despite experiencing physical fatigue. This could be a good time for quieter, less physically demanding activities that require emotional or cognitive engagement.</p>
        <p>If the emotional cycle is low, individuals may need to pay extra attention to managing stress and maintaining emotional well-being during this time. They may benefit from activities that promote relaxation, self-care, and emotional support.</p>
        <p>If the intellectual cycle is low, individuals may find it challenging to focus, solve problems, or make decisions effectively. They may need to adjust their workload or schedule tasks requiring less cognitive effort during this time.</p>
